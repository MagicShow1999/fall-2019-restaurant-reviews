We came on a Tuesday night, and there was bit of a wait, but it was so worth it! \n\nThe tuna mayo, garlic soy wings, and volcano eggs are definitely must-try's!! We were in a bit of a time crunch, but our waiter (Jun) was awesome at getting us seated, fed, and out in record time. \n\nWe'll definitely come back when we have more time to enjoy the food.

This restaurant is kind of on the outskirts of Koreatown which is nice because there's not as much foot traffic. While I usually bring dates here, my parents had been bugging me to bring them somewhere different than what they're used to. As a kid, we never had anything more than the chinese restaurant down the street so I was super excited to bring them here. My mom was a little reluctant at first but after I ordered everything she realized we were in the right place.\n\nWe ordered table bbq ribeye- super fresh, it would've been nice if the little stove's heat was more even as it felt like I was cooking a lot of it on one side. Either way, super delicious. We also ordered some tapas dishes: fried asparagus, 2 orders of crispy chicken buns, fried dumplings, roasted veggies and soy garlic wings. My parents were ABSOLUTELY blown away by the buns and all of my choices are what I generally go with so I wasn't surprised at all. Came before 6pm so got the wings half off which was nice. You can definitely end up spending a ton of money trying everything here but I 1000% recommend it if you're looking for something different.", "author": "Evan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-10-13", "description": "Came after Phantom of the Opera and it was fun fusion for sure! Last call was around 10:30pm so it worked out for us, the service was also quick at that time. Started with the chicken wings, and they really were the perfect texture, doubley crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. We ordered soy ginger and I wanted there to be a bit more sauce/flavor, but I would get the spicy version next time.\n\nNext, we had the truffle rice cakes and cheese, which was so good! The combo of creamy cheeses and rice cakes was unique and yummy, it came out gooey and bubbly.\n\nThe bulgogi came as a mountain of meat, which was great. It was smoky and yummy, but didn't come with rice, so just be aware. Definitely a big, shareable entree.\n\nLastly, we got the spicy charred chicken, which wasn't our favorite. I love spicy food, but this felt spicy for the sake of spicy, and not for flavor per se. My friends couldn't take more than a few bites (so be warned, actually kind of spicy!). \n\nThis was too much food for the three of us but we had a good amount of leftovers for later. The ambience was ~hip~ and fun and there was a cool moon light that lit the place up.

And I can't quite pick out what it was. The restaurant staff was wonderful, very knowledgeable, patient and quick.  I had the bulgogi hot stone bowl, chicken buns and truffle fries. The food wad presented beautifully and very Instagram-worthy. It ticked all the boxes! But I had much higher expectations from a restaurants with as many raving yelp reviews as Barn Joo. I think the issue was that the food while presented beautifully, tasted meh and overall was heavily fried and lacked essential flavor. \n\nI'm told the union square location is bigger and better but have never been. \n\nIn the end, I gave barn joo four stars because my husband thought it deserved five and so we split the difference :))", "author": "Maham Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-10-02", "description": "Came here on a Monday night after work for a quick meal with friends. We have heard so much buzz about this Korean gastropub we just had to try it! First off, the location is great, especially if you commute via train (it's a 10 minute walk from Penn). \n\nMake a reservation, no matter what day of the week. The restaurant is two levels, and it started filling up around 6pm, as they have a happy hour menu. The four of us were seated, and our waiter brought us water and menus. \n\nTheir food options were so unique and trendy. We opted for a few appetizers, because they all looked delicious. We ordered the crispy chicken buns, calamari and Parmesan fries. Boy did the appetizers not disappoint!!!  They were fresh and super flavorful!\n\nFor our meals, we all ordered something different. I opted for the NY Bites, which was smoked beef and potatoes. It was alright, nothing be excited about. \n\nOnce i was time for dessert, we were excited. We ordered the cheesecake with fresh fruit, a churro bowl with vanilla ice cream, and the chocolate lava cake. They were delicious, and a big serving.\n\nAll in all, the food was okay, but the appetizers took the cake. The prices are on the higher side, but that's expected for a trendy, fresh Korean gastropub. Would want to try something new next time!!

I've dined here 3 times and each time has been a wonderful experience. \n\nI highly recommend the tiger roll ( get the bigger portion because you are going to want more!) and the fried asparagus on the appetizer list. The fried asparagus is so unique in texture and is breaded so perfectly, it is absolutely divine. The tiger roll creates some beautiful flavors in your mouth. It's light, but filling. \n\nI have also had the steamed bun bulgogi ( classic and delicious) and I've enjoyed the stone bowl for bibimbap. \n\nI haven't been disappointed with anything so far, and I look forward to trying more items out on their menu. \n\nThe service has always been great and I love the atmosphere of this restaurant, very tasteful. \n\n4.6/5", "author": "Sarah P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-10-02", "description": "This place is amazing!

We were seated upstairs, it's loud and noisy both downstairs and upstairs but filled with lots of energy. \n\nStarted off with crunchy tofu, veggie japchae, nutty green salad and a ginger limeade. \n\nWe both walked all over and walked back and forth on the Brooklyn bridge so we came with an empty belly and parched too. \n\nThe limeade ginger was so refreshing and nicely quenched my thirst. \n\nThe crunchy tofu was nicely crispy and soft on the inside, lots of flavors, the fried kimchi garnish was a good balance to the crunchy tofu. \n\nThe veggie japchae was delicious, nice peppery kick and lots of great veggies. \n\nThe nutty salad was topped with sweet crunchy almonds and the dressing gave it great depth and flavor pops.\n\nWondering imagining how we could get one of these in Michigan, would be so great in Ann Arbor or in Detroit and would be a frequent haunt for me for certain. There's nothing like it in MI at all. Maybe some food for thought to the owner. ;)\n\nIt's a Monday night and we are back for more. We were seated right away, upstairs too, downstairs seems too chaotic for me. It's before 7pm. \n\nWe ordered the limeade ginger again, the crunchy tofu, nutty greens and this time trying out the truffle fries and the popcorn chicken. \n\nThe crunchy tofu didn't disappoint and were just as good as Saturday night amidst the hustle and bustle of the weekend frenzy. \n\nThe popcorn chicken was also nice and crunchy and went nicely with the smoked sriracha BBQ sauce. \n\nThe nutty salad was as good as I recalled from Saturday night, but I did have to ask for more dressing as it was rather sparse on the coverage the first round. \n\nThe truffle fries didn't meet my standards for truffle fries tonight. They smelled of truffle oil, only faintly when they were brought to the table, but I couldn't taste the oil in any of the bites and the fries were over done for my liking. I like a nice golden yellow tint to my Idaho spuds. My hubby will eat any spuds since they are potatoes after all, but not me. \n\nI will be back again for some more crunchy tofu, nutty salad, popcorn chicken and some more adventures here in the future.

We took full advantage of their HH menu. The wings are $1 each, minimum order of 5 wings, and you have the choice of soy garlic (the best) or hot \u0026 spicy. The wings are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The basket of truffle fries ($5) is nice to share. The fries are thick, crispy, and you can definitely taste the truffle. All of the soju cocktails ($6 each) are great. We ordered Midtown Forsythia, Aloe Elixir, and Passionate Barn Joo. \n\nThe restaurant gets very busy so I recommend making a reservation through Yelp. Service is great and food gets served quickly.

Reserve thru Yelp so we did not wait.  We sat in the back near the kitchen it is a tad bit more quiet.  \n\nWe ordered 5 dishes for the two of us.  We had a tempura based roll with an aioli.  Then a soft shell crab deep fried with home made tartar and a hint of truffle oil.  Then we had a bulgogi stone bowl followed by a crispy fried chicken bun and lastly their homemade vegetarian dumplings.  \n\nHighlights were the soft shell and the chicken bao.\n The sauce on and texture of the bao made the dish.

I've been eyeballing it for awhile but never had a chance to stop by. They don't take reservations so I joined the waitlist via Yelp. I'm not sure if it's a Yelp issue or a Barn Joo 35 issue but it was confusing that I mentioned to the hostess that I was on the waitlist and she had to check-in me in even though I hadnt received a notification yet. I'm not sure what would have happened if I just waited at the bar next door and never checked in other than the waitlist. Not a big deal.\n\nI waited for about 45 minutes before my table for two was ready. We were seated immediately when I approached the hostess. The restaurant was extremely busy but the staff was on top of it. We never waited an unreasonable amount of time for anything. My friend and I had a few beers and soju and then the bulgolgi, chicken wings, pork dumplings, popcorn chicken, sides of rice, and a few other things and all of it was excellent.

Went on a Sunday evening with my parents and my husband on a visit to Koreatown. Keep in mind the dishes are tapas-sized, so it's probably best to try multiple small dishes. I think we ordered 4-5 dishes altogether, which fared well amongst us all. But in all honesty, I can't recall all the dishes we had, but the ones that stood out were the Garlic Soy Chicken Wings (super tasty), Bulgogi and Jap Chae. We also ordered the deep fried gyozas, which just felt a bit too heavy.\n\nThe tapas sizes compared to the prices being on the heftier side and the fact that I can't remember all 5 dishes that we ordered qualify this place four stars rather than five.

The wait was about 30 minutes on a Friday evening although we join the Live waitlist so make sure you book a week in advance. The place is really crowded, very very crowded, but there is a second floor. \n\nWe had the kimchi pancake, bulgogi stone pot, galbi-jjim, litchi and aloe soju cocktail. The good: litchi/aloe soju cocktail, kimchi pancake. The kimchi cake is thicker than your usual Korean pancake loaded with kimchi, you immediately notice it's homemade and very unique. We loved both soju cocktail with uniquely cubed ice and blueberry in each. Both were not very sweet, but the balance between juice and soju was perfect. Another highlight was the rib stew (galbi-jjim). We loved how the ribs were very tender and the carrots/radish were well stewed. However, the rice noodle was placed at the very bottom and unfortunately did not absorb any sauce and therefore looked and tasted awful. The bulgogi pot was as expected, good but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service was on par with other trendy Korean places in midtown.

But personally, this might be slightly better in that they look out for their Yelpers with free shots upon check-in! The shot was pretty delicious too, nice and fruity!\n\nThe food is a hit or miss.

The Soy Garlic wings were fried just right and were delicious, especially given the price. \n\nI thought the Truffle Rice Cake \u0026 Cheese was going to be good, but it was too heavy and mochi-like.

We also ordered the barn special chicken boa, which I highly recommend! Soft squishy white roll stuffed with fried chicken and shredded cabbage! We also ordered a spicy pork stone bowl which is sizzling hot, is a mixture of whole grain rice, veggies and spicy pork (not that spicy), a bowl of hot soup and your choice of truffle fries, which we got or your choice of salad.
